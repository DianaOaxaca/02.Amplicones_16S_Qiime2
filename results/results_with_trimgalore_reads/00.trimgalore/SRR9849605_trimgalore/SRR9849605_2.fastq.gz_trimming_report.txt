RUN STATISTICS FOR INPUT FILE: data/SRR9849605_2.fastq.gz
=============================================
106978 sequences processed in total

Total number of sequences analysed for the sequence pair length validation: 106978

Number of sequence pairs removed because at least one read was shorter than the length cutoff (20 bp): 8472 (7.92%)
